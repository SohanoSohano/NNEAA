We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs\\nto preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input\\nspace for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive\\nuncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction\\noptimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing\\nreactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the\\ntop 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations).

We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion\\nprediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL\\nrespectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink\\nplatforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%,\\nidentifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction\\ndifficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90\\nand 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode\\nprediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly\\npredictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic\\nobject profiles and satellite glinting.

Writing a secure smart contract is now a\\ncritical issue.This paper focuses on Ether smart contracts and explains the\\nmain components of Ether, smart contract architecture and mechanism.The\\nenvironment used in this paper is the Ethernet environment, using remix online\\ncompilation platform and Solidity language, according to the four security\\nevents of American Chain, The DAO, Parity and KotET, the principles of integer\\noverflow attack, reentrant attack, access control attack and denial of service\\nattack are studied and analyzed accordingly, and the scenarios of these\\nvulnerabilities are reproduced, and the measures to prevent them are given.\\nFinally, preventive measures are given. In addition, the principles of short\\naddress attack, early transaction attack and privileged function exposure\\nattack are also introduced in detail, and security measures are proposed.As\\nvulnerabilities continue to emerge, their classification will also evolve. The\\nanalysis and research of the current vulnerabilities are also to lay a solid\\nfoundation for avoiding more vulnerabilities.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-08T12:25:34+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"AVP-AP: Self-supervised Automatic View Positioning in 3D cardiac CT via Atlas Prompting\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Xiaolin Fan\",\r\n            \"Yan Wang\",\r\n            \"Yingying Zhang\",\r\n            \"Mingkun Bao\",\r\n            \"Bosen Jia\",\r\n            \"Dong Lu\",\r\n            \"Yifan Gu\",\r\n            \"Jian Cheng\",\r\n            \"Haogang Zhu\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"Automatic view positioning is crucial for cardiac computed tomography (CT)\\nexaminations, including disease diagnosis and surgical planning.

To address this, we\\nleverage the bijection between WavLM, pitch contours, and spectrograms to\\nperform additive synthesis, integrating the resulting waveform into the model\\nto mitigate these issues.

Although our techniques are built\\non the kNN-VC framework for implementation convenience, they are broadly\\napplicable to general concatenative neural synthesis models.

The personalized scanpath\\nprediction model is then conditioned on these subject embeddings to produce\\naccurate, personalized results. Experiments on multiple eye-tracking datasets\\ndemonstrate that our method excels in FS-PSP settings and does not require any\\nfine-tuning steps at test time.

After the\\nwatermark adapter with the watermark embedding is merged with the pre-trained\\ngeneration model, the watermark information cannot be easily removed or\\nmanipulated. Therefore, P2Mark will be a reliable choice for proactively\\ntracing and protecting the copyrights of neural speech generation models in\\nopen-source white-box scenarios.

In\\nthis paper, we reveal a structural vulnerability in the mechanism: validators\\nmay not be awarded a proper profit despite winning a dispute challenge.

Our analysis demonstrates that under current designs, the\\ncompetitive pressure from validators may be insufficient to deter malicious\\nbehavior.

In this paper, we\\nrevisit human MoCap from the perspective of interaction between human body and\\nphysical world by exploring the role of pressure. Firstly, we construct a\\nlarge-scale human Motion capture dataset with Pressure, RGB and Optical sensors\\n(named MotionPRO), which comprises 70 volunteers performing 400 types of\\nmotion, encompassing a total of 12.4M pose frames. Secondly, we examine both\\nthe necessity and effectiveness of the pressure signal through two challenging\\ntasks: (1) pose and trajectory estimation based solely on pressure: We propose\\na network that incorporates a small kernel decoder and a long-short-term\\nattention module, and proof that pressure could provide accurate global\\ntrajectory and plausible lower body pose. (2) pose and trajectory estimation by\\nfusing pressure and RGB: We impose constraints on orthographic similarity along\\nthe camera axis and whole-body contact along the vertical axis to enhance the\\ncross-attention strategy to fuse pressure and RGB feature maps. Experiments\\ndemonstrate that fusing pressure with RGB features not only significantly\\nimproves performance in terms of objective metrics, but also plausibly drives\\nvirtual humans (SMPL) in 3D scene.

Then, an unsupervised scattering part feature extraction model is\\nproposed to robustly characterize the target scattering part information and\\nprovide fine-grained target representation. Finally, by aggregating the\\nknowledge of target parts to form the complete target description, the\\ninterpretability and discriminative ability of the model is improved. We\\nperform experiments on the FAST-Vehicle dataset and the SAR-ACD dataset to\\nvalidate the performance of the proposed method.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-07T07:15:08+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"Bidirectional Hierarchical Protein Multi-Modal Representation Learning\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Xuefeng Liu\",\r\n            \"Songhao Jiang\",\r\n            \"Chih-chan Tien\",\r\n            \"Jinbo Xu\",\r\n            \"Rick Stevens\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"Protein representation learning is critical for numerous biological tasks.\\nRecently, large transformer-based protein language models (pLMs) pretrained on\\nlarge scale protein sequences have demonstrated significant success in\\nsequence-based tasks.

Meanwhile, the NFB,\\nin conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by\\nevaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly,\\nallowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation\\n(NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate\\nthe influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental\\nresults demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the\\nbenchmark datasets.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-06T03:27:23+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"Data Scaling Laws for End-to-End Autonomous Driving\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Alexander Naumann\",\r\n            \"Xunjiang Gu\",\r\n            \"Tolga Dimlioglu\",\r\n            \"Mariusz Bojarski\",\r\n            \"Alperen Degirmenci\",\r\n            \"Alexander Popov\",\r\n            \"Devansh Bisla\",\r\n            \"Marco Pavone\",\r\n            \"Urs M\\u00fcller\",\r\n            \"Boris Ivanovic\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks have traditionally relied on decomposed\\napproaches, with separate modules handling perception, prediction, and\\nplanning.

Experiments\\nacross three benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet) demonstrate BEIT's known\\nrobustness while maintaining 94\\\\% accuracy on PACS and 87\\\\% on Office-Home,\\ndespite significant occlusions, outperforming CNNs and other vision\\ntransformers by margins of up to 37\\\\%. Analysis of self-attention distances\\nreveals that the BEIT dependence on global features correlates with its\\nresilience. Furthermore, our synthetic benchmarks expose critical failure\\nmodes: performance degrades sharply when occlusions disrupt object shapes e.g.\\n68\\\\% drop for external grid masking vs. 22\\\\% for internal masking. This work\\nprovides two key advances (1) a scalable method to generate OOD benchmarks\\nusing controllable noise, and (2) empirical evidence that MIM and\\nself-attention mechanism in vision transformers enhance DG by learning\\ninvariant features. These insights bridge the gap between lab-trained models\\nand real-world deployment that offer a blueprint for building AI systems that\\ngeneralise reliably under uncertainty.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-05T16:25:34+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"Multi-Phase Coupled CMOS Ring Oscillator based Potts Machine\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Yilmaz Ege Gonul\",\r\n            \"Baris Taskin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"This paper presents a coupled ring oscillator based Potts ma chine to solve\\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problems\\n  (COPs).

The core premise for\\nself-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to\\nreconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However,\\nowing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks,\\nself-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP).\\nThe IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image,\\nparticularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training\\niterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and\\neven the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult\\nto detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the\\nIMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions\\nfor IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to\\nIMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective\\nof network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation,\\nreconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three\\nsolutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive\\nconvolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for\\nregularization.

Conversely, conventional GNNs typically rely on flattened node\\nfeatures, thereby discarding vital spatial details. TGraphX overcomes these\\nlimitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features\\n(e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These\\nspatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed\\nusing 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their\\nstructure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used\\nto robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and\\nend-to-end trainability.

\"As inference-time scaling becomes critical for enhanced reasoning\\ncapabilities, it is increasingly becoming important to build models that are\\nefficient to infer. We introduce Nemotron-H, a family of 8B and 56B/47B hybrid\\nMamba-Transformer models designed to reduce inference cost for a given accuracy\\nlevel. To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers\\nin the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform\\nconstant computation and require constant memory per generated token. We show\\nthat Nemotron-H models offer either better or on-par accuracy compared to other\\nsimilarly-sized state-of-the-art open-sourced Transformer models (e.g.,\\nQwen-2.5-7B/72B and Llama-3.1-8B/70B), while being up to 3$\\\\times$ faster at\\ninference. To further increase inference speed and reduce the memory required\\nat inference time, we created Nemotron-H-47B-Base from the 56B model using a\\nnew compression via pruning and distillation technique called MiniPuzzle.\\nNemotron-H-47B-Base achieves similar accuracy to the 56B model, but is 20%\\nfaster to infer. In addition, we introduce an FP8-based training recipe and\\nshow that it can achieve on par results with BF16-based training. This recipe\\nis used to train the 56B model. All Nemotron-H models will be released, with\\nsupport in Hugging Face, NeMo, and Megatron-LM.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-04T17:41:58+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"VISTA-OCR: Towards generative and interactive end to end OCR models\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Laziz Hamdi\",\r\n            \"Amine Tamasna\",\r\n            \"Pascal Boisson\",\r\n            \"Thierry Paquet\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"We introduce \\\\textbf{VISTA-OCR} (Vision and Spatially-aware Text Analysis\\nOCR), a lightweight architecture that unifies text detection and recognition\\nwithin a single generative model.

In this work, we present a 3D-1D-0D multiscale computational\\nframework for modeling the neuro-glial-vascular unit (NGVU) in the dorsal vagal\\ncomplex (DVC). Our approach integrates a quadripartite synapse model--which\\nrepresents the interplay among excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes,\\nand vascular smooth muscle cells--with a hierarchical description of vascular\\ndynamics that couples a three-dimensional microcirculatory network with a\\none-dimensional macrocirculatory representation and a zero-dimensional synaptic\\ncomponent. By linking neuronal spiking, astrocytic calcium and gliotransmitter\\nsignaling, and vascular tone regulation, our model reproduces key features of\\nfunctional hyperemia and elucidates the feedback loops that help maintain\\ncerebral blood flow. Simulation results demonstrate that neurotransmitter\\nrelease triggers astrocytic responses that modulate vessel radius to optimize\\noxygen and nutrient delivery. This integrated framework, to our knowledge the\\nfirst model to combine these elements for the NGVU in the DVC, provides a\\nrobust and modular platform for future investigations into the pathophysiology\\nof cerebral blood flow regulation and its role in autonomic control, including\\nthe regulation of stomach function.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-03T12:42:18+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"A Sensorimotor Vision Transformer\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Konrad Gadzicki\",\r\n            \"Kerstin Schill\",\r\n            \"Christoph Zetzsche\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"This paper presents the Sensorimotor Transformer (SMT), a vision model\\ninspired by human saccadic eye movements that prioritize high-saliency regions\\nin visual input to enhance computational efficiency and reduce memory\\nconsumption.

To address this\\nissue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System,\\nthis paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on\\ndeep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is\\nestablished. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the\\nmobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance\\nbehavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior.\\nSubsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a\\nglobal path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is\\ndesigned with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations\\nthat occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the\\nrobot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the\\nproposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the\\ncommunication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving\\nthe real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that\\nfor the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the\\ndeviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence\\ncan be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates\\nthat the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning\\nability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the\\ncollaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-03T11:15:10+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"The Self-Learning Agent with a Progressive Neural Network Integrated Transformer\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Ajay Sivakumar\",\r\n            \"Shalini\",\r\n            \"Vasantha Raj\",\r\n            \"Sebastian Sylvester\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"This paper introduces a self-learning agent that integrates LLaMA 3.2 with a\\nProgressive Neural Network (PNN) for continual learning in conversational AI\\nand code generation.

Experiments on the HRSSD dataset robustly validate the\\nsuperiority of DSSN, underscoring the critical need for specialized datasets\\nand methodologies in this domain.

To address\\nthese issues, we explore the theoretical implications of relying on domain\\ninvariance, revealing the crucial role of domain-specific information in\\nmitigating the target risk for DG. Drawing from these insights, we propose\\nGenerative Classifier-driven Domain Generalization (GCDG), introducing a\\ngenerative paradigm for the DG classifier based on Gaussian Mixture Models\\n(GMMs) for each class across domains. GCDG consists of three key modules:\\nHeterogeneity Learning Classifier~(HLC), Spurious Correlation Blocking~(SCB),\\nand Diverse Component Balancing~(DCB). Concretely, HLC attempts to model the\\nfeature distributions and thereby capture valuable domain-specific information\\nvia GMMs. SCB identifies the neural units containing spurious correlations and\\nperturbs them, mitigating the risk of HLC learning spurious patterns.\\nMeanwhile, DCB ensures a balanced contribution of components in HLC, preventing\\nthe underestimation or neglect of critical components.

The primary contribution of this\\nthesis is a translation approach for general temporal graphs that utilizes the\\nstatic expansion of a temporal graph, allowing the conversion of static\\nshortcut sets into temporal shortcut sets, yielding similar results.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:38:21+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"GarmageNet: A Dataset and Scalable Representation for Generic Garment Modeling\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Siran Li\",\r\n            \"Ruiyang Liu\",\r\n            \"Chen Liu\",\r\n            \"Zhendong Wang\",\r\n            \"Gaofeng He\",\r\n            \"Yong-Lu Li\",\r\n            \"Xiaogang Jin\",\r\n            \"Huamin Wang\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"High-fidelity garment modeling remains challenging due to the lack of\\nlarge-scale, high-quality datasets and efficient representations capable of\\nhandling non-watertight, multi-layer geometries.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1546115, "end_char_idx": 1550676, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dc98632-932a-4920-bf44-2b28b674fa15": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dc98632-932a-4920-bf44-2b28b674fa15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\solos\\OneDrive\\Documents\\College\\sem 6\\NLP\\NNERAG\\V1\\data\\research_papers\\arxiv_papers.json", "file_name": "arxiv_papers.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 1692164, "creation_date": "2025-04-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc138dab-4a15-46ea-8df3-cd77f6d95399", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\solos\\OneDrive\\Documents\\College\\sem 6\\NLP\\NNERAG\\V1\\data\\research_papers\\arxiv_papers.json", "file_name": "arxiv_papers.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 1692164, "creation_date": "2025-04-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-09"}, "hash": "db426c0f53f741c017ddb089cb3edfdf5f9a5efa11e2b0d80f349c7501e946c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "335d73ac-3b06-439e-ac1d-c26427be2866", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\solos\\OneDrive\\Documents\\College\\sem 6\\NLP\\NNERAG\\V1\\data\\research_papers\\arxiv_papers.json", "file_name": "arxiv_papers.json", "file_type": "application/json", "file_size": 1692164, "creation_date": "2025-04-02", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-09"}, "hash": "d3d468e403a23d3d18102c2143d1f0d8ddb81d26aa6d4e0f5740492591daea48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a94ee7b-78b3-4ef0-a4f9-2faa3fda5649", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d32e1fe56ac31b22692890d64454edb95125db50871fefce9e62feaa8a4dc9e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The primary contribution of this\\nthesis is a translation approach for general temporal graphs that utilizes the\\nstatic expansion of a temporal graph, allowing the conversion of static\\nshortcut sets into temporal shortcut sets, yielding similar results.\",\r\n        \"published\": \"2025-04-02T08:38:21+00:00\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"title\": \"GarmageNet: A Dataset and Scalable Representation for Generic Garment Modeling\",\r\n        \"authors\": [\r\n            \"Siran Li\",\r\n            \"Ruiyang Liu\",\r\n            \"Chen Liu\",\r\n            \"Zhendong Wang\",\r\n            \"Gaofeng He\",\r\n            \"Yong-Lu Li\",\r\n            \"Xiaogang Jin\",\r\n            \"Huamin Wang\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"summary\": \"High-fidelity garment modeling remains challenging due to the lack of\\nlarge-scale, high-quality datasets and efficient representations capable of\\nhandling non-watertight, multi-layer geometries.
